# U-Design-Summer-Camp-Code
This is all the code I wrote for the U Design summer code camp class. This code was meant for a seris of challgenes in which I had to create a robot from scratch and had to program it to solve things such as mazes as well as having to go around a race course. The programs are coded in python and are meant for the Lego Mindstorm v3.
